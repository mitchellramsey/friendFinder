# Friend Finder Application

## Description

The Friend Finder application asks user to state their name, insert a link to a photo, and take a ten question survey. After the user completes
the survey, the application will take their answers and compare the differences with every other "individual" in the Friend Finder app. The app 
will populate a modal with the friend that is most closely matched. The user then is pushed into the Friend Finder Array to be a potential match
for the next user
